I got this error called when I was returning Git push
I got "fatal 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository - fatal Could not read from remote repository."
========================================
here is the solution
=========================================


First, check that your origin is set by running

git remote -v
This should show you all of the push / fetch remotes for the project.

If this returns with no output, skip to last code block.

Verify remote name / address

If this returns showing that you have remotes set, check that the name of the remote matches the remote you are using in your commands.

$git remote -v
myOrigin ssh://git@example.com:1234/myRepo.git (fetch)
myOrigin ssh://git@example.com:1234/myRepo.git (push)

# this will fail because `origin` is not set
$git push origin main

# you need to use
$git push myOrigin main
If you want to rename the remote or change the remote's URL, you'll want to first remove the old remote, and then add the correct one.

Remove the old remote

$git remote remove myOrigin
Add missing remote

You can then add in the proper remote using

$git remote add origin ssh://git@example.com:1234/myRepo.git

# this will now work as expected
$git push origin main
